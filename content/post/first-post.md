It’s been about three months since I've arrived in Korea. I am so thankful to this country, the nation of my origins. I finally feel that I’ve settled down now. I have a studio apartment in Seoul, a job as an English instructor and my foreign resident card (finally)! 

I had first visited this country about two years ago. I came here on my own, barely being able to read the signs on the road. I spent a month wandering around Seoul and trying to take in everything that I could. It was such a long, overdue trip. 

Since then, I’ve come back for a couple of more trips and finally decided to make the move to live here long term. 

I came here at a very strange time, when the world is so unstable. Again, I can only be so grateful to be here, in such a safe country. 

I don’t know for sure how long I’ll be here, but I will make the most of my time. 

Thank you Korea ♥ 감사해
