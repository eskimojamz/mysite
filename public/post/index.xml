      <description>It’s been about three months since I&amp;rsquo;ve arrived in Korea. I am so thankful to this country, the nation of my origins. I finally feel that I’ve settled down now. I have a studio apartment in Seoul, a job as an English instructor and my foreign resident card (finally)!
I had first visited this country about two years ago. I came here on my own, barely being able to read the signs on the road.</description>
